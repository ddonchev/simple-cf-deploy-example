# Description

The repository contains Multitarget Application (MTA) examples for SAP Cloud Platform Cloud Foundry environment. Examples demonstrate how to achieve different goals using MTAs and what are the capabilities of MTA Deployment service in Cloud Foundry environment.

Before you start with the examples, please make sure that:

* You are familiar with the basic concepts of Cloud Foundry, such as Cloud Foundry applications, services, service bindings
* You are familiar with the basic concepts of MTA modeling, such as MTA modules, resources and dependencies between them. For more information, you may refer to official documentation for Multitarget Applications for the Cloud Foundry Environment on the SAP Help Portal: link:https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/d04fc0e2ad894545aebfd7126384307c.html[Multitarget Applications for the Cloud Foundry Environment]

# Requirements
* Installed CloudFoundry CLI - ensure that CloudFoundry CLI is installed and working. For more information about installation of CloudFoundry CLI, please visit the official link:https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html[CloudFoundry Documentation].
* Installed MultiApps CF CLI Plugin - ensure that MultiApps CF CLI Plugin is installed and working. For more information, please visit the official link:https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/multiapps-cli-plugin#download-and-installation[GitHub Page]
* [Optional] Installed Cloud MTA Build Tool - the tool is used in some of the listed use cases. For more information please visit the official link:https://sap.github.io/cloud-mta-build-tool/[Cloud MTA Build Tool Documentation]
